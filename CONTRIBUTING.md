## How can I contribute 

### Your first code Contribution

Your contribution is to make a card for yourself which will include your name, your fact or experience, your profession and 
your social media links. Very simple.

You don't need to write any HTML or CSS, you just need to understand what the markup means so as to be able to make changes.



First you need to have a copy of this project on your own Github account so that you can have it on your local machine and begin to make changes.

1. Star this repository, then go ahead and fork it, after that it will appear on your Github account as `Youraccountname/Tech-Developers-Profile-and-experience-card`.


2. Copy the URL of the project by clicking on the large big green button with "Code" written, Open the terminal on your local machine, make sure you have Git installed. Then run `git clone 'the URL you copied'`


3. By now you have the folder in your computer, so find the folder and open it in your preferred code editor, I will use VScode as an example here.

## Building your Tech Developer Profile and Experience Card

Remember that this project is also meant to teach you and guide you how to read and heed to instructions. Make sure you read the instructions and heed to them.

1. You are only allowed to work on the `index.html` file and the `images` folder where you would be adding your image.

2. Look for the Template card with indications of green, telling you what to copy and where to paste it.

3. Copy the template that begins with `<section> `and ends with `</section>`, and paste it above after the last card, make sure you give one line for readability.

4. Now add a beautiful picture of you in the `images` folder, name the picture with your first name. 
E.g if your first name is "augustine" your image should be `augustine.png` or `augustine.jpg` as the case may be.

5. Now go ahead and add , your fact(your fact should be one statement only),your name, profession, and your social media links where indicated. DON'T MODIFY OR CHANGE ANY CLASS.

6. After that, you need to test if everything is okay, so view the project on your browser to see if your card is okay, by right clicking and clicking on `open with live server` or `open with browser`.

If there is an error, check if you modified or changed the markup or classes

## Pushing your project

If everything works, then Boom! You made it thus far

1. Open your terminal once again and run the following :
`git add images` and then commit your changes `git commit -m "Added my Image"`
    You have commited your Image to Git!. Now let commit your Tech Developer Card.  Do that my running:
`git add index.html` and then commit your changes `git commit -m "Added "your name" card"`.

2. Now push your changes to your repository on your Github account. Now run:
`git push`.

Hooray!! You are getting there!
